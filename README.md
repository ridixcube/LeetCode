## About

This repository serves as a collection of my **LeetCode solutions**. By using the **LeetSync** extension, all my LeetCode submissions are automatically synced with this repository, making it a great resource for fellow developers and learners looking to practice coding problems and review solutions. The problems span a variety of categories, such as **Arrays**, **Linked Lists**, **Dynamic Programming**, **Graphs**, **Trees**, and more.

## Features

- **Problem-wise Solutions**: Solutions are categorized by the LeetCode problem sets and their difficulty level: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
- **Clean and Readable Code**: Each solution is written in clear, concise code, accompanied by comments for better understanding.
- **Optimized Solutions**: I focus on creating the most efficient solutions for each problem, with a primary focus on time and space complexity.
- **Problem Discussion**: Brief discussions and notes are included for challenging problems, covering different approaches and potential optimizations.

## Structure

The repository is organized by problem difficulty and type. Here's how the directory structure looks:


Each problem is named based on its number or a relevant identifier.

## How to Use
